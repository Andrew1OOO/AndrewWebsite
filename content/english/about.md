I am Andrew Diab. I am currently studying computer engineering and arabic at Purdue University in Indiana. Many of the projects showcases here have been made when I was in highschool. In highschool I was an officer of my school's programming club, President of FRC Robotics team 1649, and founder of the aerospace engineering club. In my time as a freshman at Purdue, I join the ARC robotics club working on some very interesting robotics problems such as a synthetic hand, autonomous rocket league car, and a chess ai. 

On this website you can find a many of the project I have created throughout the year, including a rubix cube ai, a pathfinding visualization of A* and Dkjstras algorithm, and lots more. You may also notice that there are robotics projects aswell, these are a combintation of projects that I have completed with physical hardware to go along with the software. 

Here is a short list of my CS experience:
- Languages: Java, Python3
- Object Oriented Programming, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- Python3 Libraries (pygame, tkinter, numpy, etc.)
- GUI and graphics based applications
- Robotics control systems (WPILib, CTRE Phoenix) 
- Simple Machine Learning and AI algorithms

What I want to learn in the future:
- More advanced algortims for Robots using artificial intelligence
- Javascript
- C programming
- Cybersecurity
- Ethical Hacking
- Creating more consumer friendly products

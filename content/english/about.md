I am Andrew Diab. I am a Student at WPS(Windermere Prepartory School) who has been interesting in programming since I took my first computer science class in 9th grade. Ever since that class I have wanted to go further with my studies in this field and because my school did not offer AP computer science, I decided to take it online the following year. I am currently enrolled in IB Computer Science(HL). I have also been an officer of my school's programming club, since my sophmore year, on top of that President of Robotics for FRC team 1649. 

On this website you can find a few of the project I thought were "cool" but also showed a high level of thinking required for programming. You may also notice that there are robotics projects aswell, these are a combintation of projects that I have done in my independent study as well as project done in robotics class. 

Here is a short list of my CS experience:
- Languages: Java, Python3
- Object Oriented Programming and Polymorphism
- Python3 Libraries
- GUI and graphics based applications
- Robotics control systems (WPILib, CTRE Phoenix) 

What I want to learn in the future:
- Machine Learning and AI
- More advanced algortims for Robots
- How to apply AI to robotics
- Javascript
- Cybersecurity
- Ethical Hacking
